Types of signals in every design:

1. Global signal :  clk and rst
2. Data signals :  rdata, wdata
3. Control signal:  enables, switches

Testbench does not have any input/output specified (only module tb();)

Initial block: executes once at start of simulation at time 0
Uses of initial:
1. for initializing dump
2. Initialize variables
3. monitor
4. Randomization
5. Stop sim by end of a time

Always block: 3 types always_comb, always_ff, always_latch
Not necessary to define in verification.
Uses of Always:
1. Generating clock (without sensitivity list. Always have a finish)

`timescale 1ns/1ps (unit/precision)

For clock gen, precision, duty cycle, phase, period, freq are important
